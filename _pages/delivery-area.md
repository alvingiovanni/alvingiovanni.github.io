On this case, a delivery company (A) is acting as a 4th-party logistic for another company (B). Both companies are operating on the same general area but have split delivery area for a long time; company A handles more area than company B. However, company B wants to increase their own operation size, thus proposing company B proposes to take charge of specific areas from company A. Even though it is a 'proposal', company A as a 4th-party have no option but to accept; however is trying to counter propose which area to be handed over.

This analysis is done on behalf of company A, trying to find the best delivery area split for them; considering the delivery volume they get from company B and their own delivery volume on the specific area.
