Hi! My name is Alvin and I am an engineer that is passionate about data. I am a Civil Engineering undergraduate (Universitas Pelita Harapan, Indonesia).

I pursue my studies in engineering because I like to analyze problems and come up with its solution; for me engineering was a way I could solve real problems.
However, having working a year as a Civil Engineer I found that data is essential in analyzing problems and its solution; thus I grew passionate about data.

Pursuing my passion in data analysis I found myself working with data as an engineer in a logistic company. For 2 years I experience gathering, analyzing, and gaining insight from data; presenting my findings to coleagues, management, and stakeholders. 

Now, I am in an endeavor to advance my data analysis skill and career.
