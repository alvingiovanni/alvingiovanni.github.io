# About Me
---
Hi! My name is Alvin and I am an engineer that is passionate about data; I am a Civil Engineering undergraduate. I pursue my studies in engineering because I like to analyze problems and come up with its solution; for me engineering was a way I could solve real problems. However, having working a year as a Civil Engineer I found that data is essential in analyzing problems and its solution; thus I grew passionate about data. Pursuing my passion in data analysis I found myself working with data as an engineer in a logistic company. For 2 years I experience gathering, analyzing, and gaining insight from data; presenting my findings to colleagues, management, and stakeholders. 

Now, I am in an endeavor to advance my data analysis skill and career.
